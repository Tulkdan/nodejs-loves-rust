# Linking Rust code into NodeJS example

This project is a mini project to use it as an example for using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) to build a native module to be used on NodeJS.

The main branch should be empty and you should navigate through the branches for the different methods that I have found over the web.

## References

This method implements a native module using N-API ([Node-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html)) with [nodejs-sys](https://github.com/elmarx/nodejs-sys) crate to make it easier to use the N-API.

Also, this is only the implementations of [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/rust-and-node-js-a-match-made-in-heaven/) from LogRocket with some minor changes to test each example given on the article.
